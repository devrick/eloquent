Problem:
I ran into an issue with how to properly use length. I tried using it as it was applied in the example. What the example description was stating was to use it to find the length of the string. This is a very important distinction that I did not grasp right away. Since we are not counting numbers, but hashes, we are counting the length of the string. The length of the string makes a number that can be used in an expression to compare it to another number.

Code:
for(var i = "#"; i.length < 8; i += "#"){
  console.log(i);
}
